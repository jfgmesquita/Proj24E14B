# Interdisciplinary Group Project in Java

## Object-Oriented Programming and Scrum (Agile)

#### Using Eclipse, Git and Trello

***

Learning objectives: Recognize the objectives and concepts of agile approaches (SCRUM) for information systems development, using techniques for requirements identification and writing requirements using User Stories.
Recognize the objectives and concepts of the object-oriented programming paradigm, designing and implementing a Java application that meets the specified requirements.

The team sought to develop a solution (software application) to solve a real-world problem, contributing to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically SDG 11.

The adverse environmental impact of cities, especially poor air quality and waste management, and the lack of sustainability in cities are two of the main problems that SDG 11 aims to combat.

As a solution to the mentioned problems, our application will help any interested in acquiring solar panels by calculating the necessary initial investment, the monthly expenses after the panels are installed, the time required for the total financial return on the investment, the contribution to the fight against environmental impact, among other data.
